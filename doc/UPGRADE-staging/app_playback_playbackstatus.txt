Subject: app_playback

In Asterisk 11, if a channel was redirected away during Playback(),
the PLAYBACKSTATUS variable would be set to SUCCESS. In Asterisk 12
(specifically commit 7d9871b3940fa50e85039aef6a8fb9870a7615b9) that
behavior was inadvertently changed and the same operation would result
in the PLAYBACKSTATUS variable being set to FAILED. The Asterisk 11
behavior has been restored.
