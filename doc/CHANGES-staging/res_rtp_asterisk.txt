Subject: res_rtp_asterisk

This module has been updated to provide additional
quality statistics in the form of an Asterisk
Media Experience Score.  The score is available using
the same mechanisms you'd use to retrieve jitter, loss,
and rtt statistics.  For more information about the
score and how to retrieve it, see
